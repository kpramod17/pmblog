    <p>Welcome to my blog where I share insights and experiences about product management and career growth. Here are some of the topics I plan to write about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Belief in yourself. Smartness in adults is age-agnostic.</li>
        <li>Don't be too theoretical. Do all the discovery that you want but not at the cost of inaction. Sometimes, the cost of discovery is higher.</li>
    </ul>
