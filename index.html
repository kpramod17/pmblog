        Hi, I'm Pramod Panchagnula, a Senior Product Manager at Coding Ninjas in Gurugram, India. With over 7 years of experience working in startups, I've focused on growth strategies and have a proven track record of scaling businesses. My goal is to become a Growth Product Manager at a MAANG company and eventually a technology entrepreneur in education or healthcare.

        Previously, I have held roles as a Program Manager at Leap Scholar and co-founded Scale Labs, where I managed significant projects and teams, contributing to substantial revenue growth and operational efficiency.

        I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Instrumentation from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani. My technical skills include SQL, Python, MATLAB, R, Excel (Advanced), Tableau, and Jira.

        When I'm not working, I enjoy writing, reading, and gardening. I've written articles for Critique magazine and published a short story, read 24 books in 2023, and maintain a home garden with over 20 varieties of vegetables and fruits.
